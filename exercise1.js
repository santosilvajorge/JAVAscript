ASSIGNMENT RULES
- All the answers must be written in JavaScript
- You can ask for help, reach the Teaching Assistants if needed
- You can Google / use StackOverflow BUT only when you think you need something we didn't cover during lessons yet
- You can test your code in a separate file or de-commenting the single exercises in this one.
- You can use the bash terminal, the VSCode terminal or the one embedded in your Operating System if you're using macOS or Linux.
*/


 'EXERCISE 1'
 /*
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/*`There are 5 main dataTypes in javaScript:
 - strings - are a text that comes inbetween "" or ''
 - numbers - is like the name said a number
 - booleans - is a True/False information about a particular case
 - undefined - is like the name said something that is not defined
 - null - is a null value Â´


 'EXERCISE 2'
 /*
 Try to describe what an object is, in your own words.
*/

/* "Objects you can think it like a box where you can add all diferent types of data in order to create a single structure." */

 'EXERCISE 3'
 /*
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* let firstVar = 12
let secondVar =20

console.log(firstVar + secondVar)
*/

 'EXERCISE 4'
 /*
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/* let xVar = 12 */

 'EXERCISE 5'
 /*
 Create a variable called name and assign to it your name as a string.
*/

/* let nameVar = "Jorge" */

 'EXERCISE 6'
 /*
 Execute a subtraction between the number 4 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* console.log(xVar - 4) */

 'EXERCISE 7'
 /*
Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
 YOU DON'T NEED AN IF/ELSE BLOCK. It is enough to use console.log()
*/

/*
let name1Var = "john"
let name2Var = "John"

console.log(name1Var == name2Var) 
*/
